## Task Overview: Conversational IVR using Kore.ai and Node.js Integration

This discussion focuses on the task of creating a Conversational IVR system using Kore.ai, integrated with the knowledge of Node.js.

### Key Components in Kore.ai's Bot Builder

- Define Intents: These are the purposes or goals that a user might express during interaction.
- Create Entities: These are important pieces of information contained within the user's speech.
- Build Dialog Tasks: These drive the conversation based on the user's intents and provided information.

### Training the NLU Model

- The model is trained by inputting and annotating sample user dialogues in the Bot Builder.
- The system then uses this data to understand and categorize new user inputs.
- It responds based on the user's intent and extracted entities.

### Dynamic Response and Evaluation

- During conversations, the Bot Builder adjusts responses based on the content of user inputs.
- It assesses the user's speech and emotions, tailoring the interaction accordingly.

## Implementing Node.js Server-Side and Kore.ai SDK

### Key Steps

1. **Receive Input from IVR System**: 
   - The first step involves capturing user input from the IVR system.

2. **Convert Voice to Text**: 
   - This step may require a speech recognition service to translate voice input into text.

3. **Send Text to Kore.ai Bot Using SDK**: 
   - Utilize the Kore.ai SDK to forward the converted text to the Kore.ai Bot for processing.

4. **Receive Response from Bot**: 
   - The Bot processes the input and sends back a response.

5. **Convert Text Response to Voice**: 
   - Use a text-to-speech service to convert the Bot's text response into a voice format.

6. **Send Voice Response Back to IVR System**: 
   - Finally, relay the voice response back to the IVR system for the user to hear.

This structured approach outlines the integration process, highlighting the interaction between Node.js, Kore.ai SDK, and the necessary conversion services for a seamless IVR experience.

### 1. Using Node.js to Handle IVR Inputs
To handle inputs from an IVR system using Node.js, you typically work with HTTP requests. Here's a basic example using Express.js, which sets up an endpoint to receive POST requests from the IVR system:
``` node.js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Body parser middleware to handle JSON and URL encoded bodies
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// POST endpoint to receive IVR input
app.post('/ivr/input', (req, res) => {
    // Expecting IVR system's input data in the request body
    const ivrInput = req.body;

    console.log('Received IVR input:', ivrInput);

    // Process the IVR input here, such as converting speech to text, etc.

    // Assuming processing is complete, return a confirmation response
    res.json({ status: 'success', message: 'Input received' });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```
This code sets up an Express.js server with a POST endpoint to handle inputs from an IVR system, demonstrating basic request handling and response sending.
In this code, any POST requests sent to the `/ivr/input` endpoint are received by the server and the input data is logged. You'll need to adapt the handling of `ivrInput` based on the specific format in which the IVR system sends data. Beyond just receiving data, real-world applications may require additional validation and error handling.

### 2. Send Text to Kore.ai Bot Using SDK
Based on the Kore.ai SDK documentation provided, here's a sample code snippet demonstrating how to send a text message to a Kore.ai bot using the Kore.ai SDK:

``` node.js
const sdk = require('kore-bot-sdk-js');

// Bot configuration details
const botOptions = {
  botInfo: { name: "your_bot_name", id: "your_bot_id" },
  // Configure authentication details (obtained from Kore.ai bot platform)
  clientId: 'your_client_id',
  clientSecret: 'your_client_secret'
};

// Initialize and register the Bot
sdk.registerBot(botOptions);

// Example callback function to handle user messages
function onUserMessage(requestId, userPayload, callback) {
  // userPayload contains the user's message and other data
  console.log('Received message from user:', userPayload.message);
  
  // Construct the payload to send to the Bot
  const botPayload = {
    message: userPayload.message,
    channel: userPayload.channel,
    context: userPayload.context || {}
  };

  // Send message to the Bot
  sdk.sendBotMessage(botPayload, function(err, botResponse) {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error sending message to bot:', err);
      callback(err);
    } else {
      console.log('Received response from bot:', botResponse);
      callback(null, botResponse);
    }
  });
}

// Example: Triggered when a user message is received
onUserMessage('uniqueRequestId', { message: "Hi there!", channel: 'web', context: {} }, (err, response) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Error:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('Bot says:', response);
  }
});
```
Please note that the above code snippet should be aligned with your specific Kore.ai bot setup and logic. You'll need to replace placeholders (such as `your_bot_name`, `your_bot_id`, `your_client_id`, `your_client_secret`) with actual values. This is a basic example, and you may need to tailor it further according to your specific business logic.

### 3. Using Kore.ai SDK to Receive Bot Responses
Based on the SDK documentation, here's an example code snippet demonstrating how to use the Kore.ai SDK to receive responses from a Bot:
``` node.js
// Inside your event handler function, e.g., on_user_message
function onUserMessage(requestId, userPayload, callback) {
  // ... Assume you have processed the user message and constructed the payload to send to the Bot
  
  // Send message to the Bot
  sdk.sendBotMessage(userPayload, (err, botResponse) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error while sending message to bot:', err);
      return callback(err);
    }
    // Successfully received response from the Bot
    console.log('Received response from bot:', botResponse);

    // Process the Bot's response based on your business logic
    // ...

    // After processing, send the response via callback
    callback(null, botResponse);
  });
}
```
This code illustrates the process of sending a message to the Bot and receiving a response within a user message event handler. The `sendBotMessage` function is utilized to dispatch the message to the Bot, followed by awaiting the Bot's response. The callback function handles the Bot's reply, and you can build upon this to further process these responses. For instance, you might convert the responses into speech or execute additional actions based on the Bot's feedback.


### 4. Sending Voice Responses Back to the IVR System
Sending a voice response back to an IVR system typically involves interacting with the IVR system's API. Here's an example code block that simulates this process:

``` node.js
const axios = require('axios'); // Import axios for HTTP requests

// Assume this function is called after you get a text response from Kore.ai
function sendResponseToIVR(ivrApiUrl, sessionId, textResponse) {
    // Logic to convert text response to voice should be handled here, or by the IVR system
    // Here, we assume the IVR system expects text as input
    const ivrPayload = {
        sessionId: sessionId, // Session ID with the IVR system
        response: textResponse, // Text response from the chatbot
        // ... additional parameters may be needed, depending on the IVR API requirements
    };

    // Use axios to send a POST request to the IVR system
    axios.post(ivrApiUrl, ivrPayload)
        .then(response => {
            console.log('IVR response sent successfully:', response.data);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error sending response to IVR:', error);
        });
}
```
In this example, `ivrApiUrl` represents the URL of the IVR system's API endpoint, `sessionId` is the unique identifier associated with the IVR session, and `textResponse` is the textual response you receive from the Kore.ai chatbot. This function packages these pieces of data and sends them back to the IVR system.

## Enhancing Your System: Supplementary Features for Improved Functionality
To enhance your system, consider implementing these additional features:

### Historical Message Retrieval (`sdk.getMessages`)
Retrieve conversation history for better context understanding and tracking of previous user interactions.

### Session Management (`sdk.clearAgentSession`, `sdk.startAgentSession`, `sdk.closeConversationSession`)
Manage agent sessions by clearing or initiating them as needed, and appropriately closing conversation sessions.

### Asynchronous Response Handling (`sdk.AsyncResponse`, `sdk.respondToHook`)
Implement asynchronous responses for tasks that may require extended processing time.

### Session Extension (`sdk.extendRequestId`)
Use this feature to extend the validity of a request ID when more time is needed to process a user's request.

### Session Reset (`sdk.resetBot`)
Clear context and discard current tasks when a user wishes to restart the conversation.

### Metadata Tags (`metaTags`)
Add metadata tags to users, messages, and sessions for improved tracking and management.

These supplementary features can be implemented based on your specific business logic and needs. You may need to write corresponding event handling logic based on user behavior or other triggering conditions. Ensure to follow best practices in implementing these features, such as error handling, logging, and secure communication with the Kore.ai platform.
